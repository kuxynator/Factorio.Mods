Version 0.3.59 - Notes

Always Backup your Savegame before Update !

changes/fixes:
- balance slag-tile-recipes 
- removed convert reputation->tech-signs
- changed modified-substation to get early access in game
- added new ground-floor lamps
- reorder/organisation some recipes-lines (shifted recipes around)


prepare for remove:
* because tech-signs still produce a huge fps-drop if you cancel a recipe, i will slowly remove them,
this experiment is from this perspective a failure. also too fix this issue i need to simplify many recipes 
to a lower tech-tree-deep/dependency. it's nearly unplayable, if you try to search in research-tab and hover over a research ^^
(without any research in YI but affects vanilla) - or chancel a handcraft-queue
