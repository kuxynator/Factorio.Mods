Version 0.2.31 - Notes

Always Backup your Savegame before Update !

solved problems
- solar-dish-stirling - produce no energy
- fluid-tanks - content-fluid-bar in correct place or off
- all Entity-Descriptions off - because game cut's them no more -> long descriptions breaks the UI
- new turrets included
- to not break save-games - old turrets change on remove
- old turrets can't no longer produced 
- ZTT-weapon - graphic changes 

i don't know the reason for now - (no fix)
- accumulators don't work in god-mode
