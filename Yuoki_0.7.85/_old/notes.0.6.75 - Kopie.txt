Version 0.6.75 - Notes

Always Backup your Savegame before Update !

removed:
- Steam-Overheater
- Water Mixer

changes/fixes:
- all Steam-Generators use 250°C Steam
- all MF-Generators use 150°C MF
- fluid consumption changed to these temperatures
- Obninsk back to working condition
- MEG now size 5x3

new:
- Obninsk cycle to produce better fuel for this reactor
- Obninsk devilers directly MF (from fusion fuel), for MF-Generators

Fusion Fuel Types can only used in YI-Reactors
- Alien Fuel Cell - 300 MJ
- MX-A Fusion Fuel - 1 GJ
- MX-C Fusion Fuel - 7 GJ

Radiation-Cycle 
Prepare Fuel -> Radiate in Reactor Cycle -> Cooling -> Ready to use as reactor-fuel.
drawback MF-Output is very low, so better you have 2 or more reactors and 1 dedicated to produce fuel.
