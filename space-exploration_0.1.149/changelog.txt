Version: 0.1.42
  Features:
    - Added Antimatter Reactors. Antimatter can be manufactured where there is abundant energy (like a star), and used to power somewhere energy poor (like deep space).

    - Rocket silo research is now cheaper and faster.
    - Meteor defence installation accuracy reduced to 80%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.33
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved the on/off flicker of space science labs but it is still not perfect. The graphics still need to be redone to remove the flicker completely, but the graphics need to be updated anyway to remove the pipes.
    - Fixed that cargo pods couldn't be placed in space, and therefore would be destroyed by the game engine if the tile under them was changed while in space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.32
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed supercomputer in SR using HR graphics that got cut off.
